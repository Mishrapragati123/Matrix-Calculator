# Matrix-Calculator
The repository contains a web application for matrix multiplication. Users can input two matrices, and upon clicking the "Calculate" button, the application performs the multiplication operation and displays the result. The interface is simple and intuitive, with text areas for matrix input and a visually clear display for the resulting matrix.
